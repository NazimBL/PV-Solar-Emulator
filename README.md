# PV-Solar-Emulator
PhotoVoltaic Solar Emulator with STM32 &amp; AVR microcontrollers.


The Solar PV Emulator is a programmable power supply designed to emulate solar panels. 
With fast transient response, the emulator responds to change in load conditions and maintains the output on IV characteristics 
of the selected panel for a given ambient condition. It is a flexible instrument designed to emulate the output of solar panels 
from different manufacturers, variations due to time of the day, effect of season and different geographical locations of installation.
